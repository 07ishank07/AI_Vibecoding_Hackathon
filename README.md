**Status:** ✅ All systems operational

## 📱 How It Works
1. **Create Profile**: Visit `/create-profile` for 4-step wizard
2. **Generate QR Code**: Automatic QR generation for wallet/ID
3. **Emergency Access**: Scan QR → `/emergency/[username]`
4. **AI Voice**: Medical summary in responder's language
5. **Auto-Notify**: SMS alerts to emergency contacts

## 🎯 Current Features

Technical Specification: CrisisLink.cv
CrisisLink.cv is a specialized "Emergency Life Passport" system designed to provide instant, secure access to medical information during emergencies via QR codes and .cv domains.

1. System Architecture
The application follows a modern decoupled architecture:

Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11) with SQLAlchemy ORM.
Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS.
Database: PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
Identity Layer: Integrated with the Ola API for .cv domain resolution and identity mapping.
AI/Agent Layer: LeanMCP orchestration for specialized emergency agents.
2. Core Components
2.1 Backend Services
app.main: Entry point for FastAPI, managing CORS, middleware, and router inclusion.
app.config: Centralized settings via Pydantic BaseSettings, loading from 
.env
.
app.database: SQLAlchemy engine and session management.
2.2 Domain Logic & Services
AI Voice (app.services.ai_voice): Generates emergency speech using the AIML API (TTS). It constructs a standardized medical summary.
Notifications (app.services.notifications): Integrates with Twilio for automated SMS alerts to emergency contacts when a profile is accessed.
Encryption (app.utils.encryption): Uses Fernet (symmetric encryption) to secure sensitive medical data (allergies, medications, medical_conditions) before storage.
QR Generator (app.utils.qr_generator): Creates base64-encoded PNG QR codes pointing to crisislink.cv/username.
3. Data Schema (SQLAlchemy)
User
id (UUID): Primary key.
username (String): Unique identifier and .cv subpath.
hashed_password (String): Securely stored credentials.
MedicalProfile
user_id (ForeignKey): Links to 
User
.
full_name, date_of_birth, blood_type: Publicly accessible emergency info.
allergies, medications, medical_conditions: Encrypted text blobs.
languages: JSON array of spoken languages for the AI Voice agent.
EmergencyContact
user_id (ForeignKey): Owner of the contact.
name, phone, email: Contact details.
relation (String): The relationship type (renamed from relationship to avoid SQLAlchemy shadowing).
priority (Integer): Order of notification.
EmergencyAccess
user_id (ForeignKey): Target profile.
responder_info: Metadata about the person accessing the profile (IP/Agent).
access_type: qr_scan or url_access.
4. Identity & Deployment
Identity Layer (
cv.json
)
The project includes a root manifest mapping the app to the .cv ecosystem:

Defines the crisislink.cv domain.
Maps the OLA_API_KEY for identity layer authentication.
Infrastructure
Docker: Containerized services for Postgres, Backend, and Frontend.
Environment: Root 
.env
 handles secrets like OLA_API_KEY, AIML_API_KEY, and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN.
5. Agentic Framework (MCP)
Located in mcp-agents/, providing specialized logic:

Crisis Analyzer: Evaluates the severity of reported incidents.
Medical Retriever: Fetches relevant patient history from the encrypted vault.
Translator: Bridges language gaps between patients and responders.
Mental Health Router: Specialized routing for psychological crises.
Contact Dispatcher: Manages the priority queue for notifications.
6. API Endpoints
POST /api/profiles/: Create and encrypt a new medical profile + generate QR.
GET /api/emergency/{username}: Public endpoint for responders; returns decrypted data and triggers notifications.
GET /api/emergency/{username}/voice: Returns a voice-ready medical brief.
GET /health: System health monitoring.
