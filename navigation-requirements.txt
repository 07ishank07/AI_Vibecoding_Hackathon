CrisisLink.cv Navigation Requirements
====================================

CURRENT NAVIGATION STATUS:
- No consistent navigation between pages
- Users must use browser back/forward or type URLs
- Links exist but scattered across pages

REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS:
=====================

1. USER CONTEXT PRIORITY:
✅ Medical professionals emphasized but public pages must be nice/accessible
✅ Both user types important, medical professionals get additional features

2. EMERGENCY vs NON-EMERGENCY CONTEXT:
✅ Emergency pages: Distraction-free, minimal navigation
✅ Profile creation/management: Full contextual navigation
✅ Different navigation for different contexts

3. DEVICE USAGE PATTERNS:
✅ Profile creation + Emergency access: Mobile-considered
✅ In-depth profile info: Desktop-oriented
✅ Navigation should adapt to page context

4. NAVIGATION COMPLEXITY:
✅ Standard: Home, About, Login, Create Profile, Dashboard, Profile Preview, Emergency Demo

5. MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL WORKFLOW:
✅ Additional items: Medical Dashboard, Emergency Tools
✅ Enhanced features for medical professionals
