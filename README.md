CrisisLink.cv - Emergency Medical ID System
The Core Idea (Super Simple)
A QR code on your phone/bracelet that first responders scan to instantly see:

Your medical conditions & allergies
Emergency contacts (auto-notified when scanned)
What language you speak
Basic identity info

One sentence: Scan QR → See medical info → Contact family → Save time in emergencies.
Why It Matters

30% of ER deaths could be prevented with faster patient info access
Works when you're unconscious or can't speak
No locked phones, no language barriers
