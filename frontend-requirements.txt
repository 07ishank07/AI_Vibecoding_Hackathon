PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Emergency medical information system with QR code access

   ✓ PRIMARY FOCUS: Emergency access experience
   ✓ Mobile-first for user profiles, desktop-optimized for medical access
   ✓ Accessibility critical for emergency situations

   ✓ Emergency contacts optional for basic profile view

4. PROFILE CREATION FLOW:
   ✓ Multi-step wizard approach
   ✓ Photos heavily recommended but not mandatory
